## Capture Charges

Use this payload to capture a previous pre-authorized [Charge](Charges.md). This is known known as a post-authorization. This will settle (withdrawl) funds from the customer.

<!-- theme: warning -->

> ##### Authorization Hold Times
>
> Issuers have different hold times for pre-authorizations. If the authorization has been released it is recommended to process a new charge.

##### Capture Types

- **Automatic Capture** : A charge is automatically captured when a [Sale](../FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#Sale) or [Deferred Payment](Deferred-Payment.md) request is made.
- **Manual Capture** : A manual capture can be processed for the full amount or a partial amount.
  - **Full** : A full capture request will settle the full amount of the held funds. This amount can be for more than the amount for certain industries (e.g., tips).
  - **Partial** : A partial capture request is used when the full pre-auth amount is not needed or when submitting a [Split Shipment](Split-Shipment.md). When the full amount is not captured the remaining balance is released to the customer (e.g., the price of a pre-order item decreases before shipping).
